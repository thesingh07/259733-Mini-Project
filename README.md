## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

1. I was not aware how to incorporate badges but Bharath sir and Prithvi sir on connect sessions help us to overcome the issue.
2. I am still unable to use multifile concept because of which my src files are empty and my whole code is in main.c . Will try to learn it and incorporate that later.
3. I have done manual testing but unity testing is not done due to unablability of src folder and multifile.
4. As my implementation is not upto the mark, standard makefile will not work for me. So I had made changes in makefile according to my implementation.
